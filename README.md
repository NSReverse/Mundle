# Mundle
This app allows for teachers to provide a feed of messages, assignments, and projects to students. This app will also be my submission as a Udacity capstone project. With that in mind, I would like to ask for no contribution until the project has been submitted and graded as passing. Thank you for viewing this project.

### This app is now Completed.
This app has fulfilled all prerequisites set forth by planning between Udacity and I. Now bug fixes, enhancements, and documentation can be implemented.

### Using the source code.
##### Using your own Parse Server
You may set the address to your own Parse server instead of mine by changing the String constants located in ServerConfig.java

##### Using code from this app in your own app.
You are free to use code from this app as long as you attribute to it and include a link to the source code. Also, shoot me an email about your project if you wish. I'd love to hear about this helps you.
